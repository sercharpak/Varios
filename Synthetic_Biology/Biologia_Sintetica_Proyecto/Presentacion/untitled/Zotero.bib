	abstract = {Conventional methodologies to control vector borne diseases with chemical pesticides are often associated with environmental toxicity, adverse effects on human health and the emergence of insect resistance. In the paratransgenic strategy, symbiotic or commensal microbes of host insects are transformed to express gene products that interfere with pathogen transmission. These genetically altered microbes are re-introduced back to the insect where expression of the engineered molecules decreases the host's ability to transmit the pathogen. We have successfully utilized this strategy to reduce carriage rates of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, in the triatomine bug, Rhodnius prolixus, and are currently developing this methodology to control the transmission of Leishmania donovani by the sand fly Phlebotomus argentipes. Several effector molecules, including antimicrobial peptides and highly specific single chain antibodies, are currently being explored for their anti-parasite activities in these two systems. In preparation for eventual field use, we are actively engaged in risk assessment studies addressing the issue of horizontal gene transfer from the modified bacteria to environmental microbes.},

About 95-99\% of the total populations of both symbionts developed in the anterior midgut regions, i.e., cardia and stomach. The passage from the blood-storing stomach to the digesting small intestine caused a considerable breakdown of symbiont populations, and only about 0.01\% of the total population was present in the rectum. These were excreted mainly within 4 h after a blood meal. After infection with three species of trypanosomatids, R. rhodnii, the symbiont of R. prolixus, was affected by Trypanosoma rangeli, but not by Blastocrithidia triatomae or Trypanosoma cruzi. On the other hand, in T. infestans the concentration of Nocardia sp. was reduced after infection with B. triatomae, but not by T. rangeli nor T. cruzi. In long-term B. triatomae-infected T. infestans, this reduction and a reduced diuretic activity after feeding synergistically lowered the symbiont concentration in the singly deposited feces/urine drops drastically compared to uninfected controls. These data strongly support the theory of the mechanisms of pathogenicity of T. rangeli and B. triatomae for R. prolixus and T. infestans, respectively, that the primal point of attack is the host-specific symbiont, R. rhodnii and Nocardia sp., respectively.},

	abstract = {An important problem in microbial ecology is to identify those phenotypic attributes that are responsible for competitive fitness in a particular environment. Thousands of papers have been published on the physiology, biochemistry, and molecular genetics of Escherichia coli and other bacterial models. Nonetheless, little is known about what makes one genotype a better competitor than another even in such well studied systems. Here, we review experiments to identify the phenotypic bases of improved competitive fitness in twelve E. coli populations that evolved for thousands of generations in a defined environment, in which glucose was the limiting substrate. After 10,000 generations, the average fitness of the derived genotypes had increased by approximately 50\% relative to the ancestor, based on competition experiments using marked strains in the same environment. The growth kinetics of the ancestral and derived genotypes showed that the latter have a shorter lag phase upon transfer into fresh medium and a higher maximum growth rate. Competition experiments were also performed in environments where other substrates were substituted for glucose. The derived genotypes are generally more fit in competition for those substrates that use the same mechanism of transport as glucose, which suggests that enhanced transport was an important target of natural selection in the evolutionary environment. All of the derived genotypes produce much larger cells than does the ancestor, even when both types are forced to grow at the same rate. Some but not all, of the derived genotypes also have greatly elevated mutation rates. Efforts are now underway to identify the genetic changes that underlie those phenotypic changes, especially substrate specificity and elevated mutation rate for which there are good candidate loci. Identification and subsequent manipulation of these genes may provide new insights into the reproducibility of adaptive evolution, the importance of co-adapted gene complexes, and the extent to which distinct phenotypes (e.g., substrate specificity and cell size) are affected by the same mutations.},

	abstract = {Conjugative plasmids are extra-chromosomal DNA elements that are capable of horizontal transmission and are found in many natural isolated bacteria. Although plasmids may carry beneficial genes to their bacterial host, they may also cause a fitness cost. In this work, we studied the evolution of the R1 plasmid and we found that, in spite of the R1 plasmid conferring an initial cost to its host, after 420 generations the cost disappeared in all five independent evolution experiments. In fact, in two of these five experiments evolved conjugative plasmids actually conferred a fitness advantage to their hosts. Furthermore, the relative fitness of the ancestral clone bearing one of the evolved plasmids is significantly higher than both the plasmid-free ancestral cells and the evolved cells carrying the evolved plasmid. Given that the R1 plasmid may spread among different species of enterobacteria, we wondered what the effect of the evolved plasmid would be inside Salmonella enterica cells. We found that the evolved plasmid is also able to dramatically increase the relative fitness of these cells. Our results suggest that even if general usage of antibiotics is halted, conjugative plasmids that have been selected with antibiotics in previous years can still persist among bacterial populations or even invade new strains.},

	abstract = {Elimination of vector populations through the use of insecticides is the principal means of controlling Chagas disease. Because of the limitations of insecticide use, we have been developing a new potential method of control, to be used in conjunction with insecticide programs, a method which utilizes genetically modified symbiotic bacteria. These transformed bacteria can express anti-parasitic agents in the gut of the bug where the trypanosomes also are found. Previous studies have shown that it is possible to transform Rhodococcus rhodnii with a shuttle plasmid that contains the gene for cecropin A, an insect anti-microbial peptide. The bacteria expressed this peptide and reduced or eliminated the number of trypanosomes in the bug Rhodnius prolixus [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 94 (1997) 3274]. In an effort to improve efficacy and transformation stability, we have begun using plasmids that contain integrative elements from the L1 mycobacteriophage to insert DNA into the genome of the bacterium. The integrative plasmid pBP5 contains the attachment site (attP) and integrase gene (int) of the L1 mycobacteriophage, an antibiotic resistance gene and the lacZ gene. After transforming R. rhodnii with pBP5, nine positive clones were obtained and six different insertions sites were identified. In each clone, the integrative plasmid is inserted only once, the lacZ gene is expressed intensely and, all clones but one, remained stable for 100 generations of culture in the absence of antibiotic selection. In addition, the construct remains stable throughout the life cycle of the bug. These data demonstrate that L1 mycobacteriophage integrative plasmids are significantly more stable than episomally located plasmids used in previous studies and will be greatly beneficial for use in the transformation of symbiotic bacteria of Chagas disease vectors.},

The linker sequence was derived from the VH-CH1 elbow region. The C kappa domain provides a sensitive detection tail for Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Periplasmic extracts of transformed E. coli contained material that bound progesterone and related steroids with similar specificity and affinity to DB3, and displayed the DB3 idiotype and kappa chain epitopes. Reference to the crystal structure of DB3 suggests that all the characteristics of the combining site interaction with steroids are retained in the bacterially expressed material. Western blotting demonstrated material with a molecular weight equivalent to three domains after reduction, but six domains in the unreduced state, suggesting that the VH/K polypeptide is assembled in the periplasm as a disulphide-bridged dimer. The VH/K construct provides a novel route to expression of antibody combining sites in E. coli for antibody engineering.},
